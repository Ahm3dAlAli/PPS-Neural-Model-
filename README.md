üéâ Introduction

Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive impairments. One area of research that has received a lot of attention in recent years is the study of peripersonal space perception in schizophrenia.

Peripersonal space refers to the space surrounding our bodies that we can reach and interact with. There is evidence to suggest that people with schizophrenia have a distorted perception of peripersonal space, which may contribute to their symptoms.

The aim of this project is to use computational cognitive neuroscience techniques to investigate the relationship between schizophrenia and peripersonal space perception.

üìà Methods

We used a range of computational models to simulate the cognitive processes involved in peripersonal space perception. These models were designed to mimic the neural circuits involved in this process and were calibrated using data from healthy individuals.

We then used these models to simulate the effects of schizophrenia on peripersonal space perception. Specifically, we looked at how changes in neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity, as well as other factors, could affect the perception of peripersonal space in people with schizophrenia.

üìä Results

Our results show that changes in neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity can indeed affect peripersonal space perception in people with schizophrenia. We found that people with schizophrenia have a smaller peripersonal space boundary, which may contribute to their symptoms.

üí¨ Discussion

These findings have important implications for our understanding of schizophrenia and may help to develop new treatments for this debilitating disorder. By using computational models, we were able to gain new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying peripersonal space perception and how they are affected by schizophrenia.
