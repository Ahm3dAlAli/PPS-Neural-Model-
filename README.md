# üß† Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Project üåê

Welcome to my computational cognitive neuroscience project! This project is focused on investigating the relationship between schizophrenia and the perception of peripersonal space. The aim of this project is to use computational cognitive neuroscience techniques to gain new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying peripersonal space perception and how they are affected by schizophrenia.

## üéâ Introduction

Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive impairments. One area of research that has received a lot of attention in recent years is the study of peripersonal space perception in schizophrenia.

Peripersonal space refers to the space surrounding our bodies that we can reach and interact with. There is evidence to suggest that people with schizophrenia have a distorted perception of peripersonal space, which may contribute to their symptoms.

## üìö Literature Review

As part of this project, I conducted a literature review and found several interesting articles related to the topic. Here are some of the most relevant ones:

Di Cosmo et al. (2018) - Peripersonal space boundary in schizotypy and schizophrenia.
Hoffman and Dobscha (1989) - Cortical pruning and the development of schizophrenia: a computer model.
Makin et al. (2008) - On the other hand: Dummy hands and peripersonal space.
Murray et al. (2016) - Linking microcircuit dysfunction to cognitive impairment: effects of disinhibition associated with schizophrenia in a cortical working memory model.
Rabinovich et al. (2008) - Transcranial magnetic stimulation and synaptic plasticity.
Schizophrenia.com (2021) - What is Schizophrenia?
Shams and Seitz (2008) - Benefits of multisensory learning.

## üìà Methods

We used a range of computational models to simulate the cognitive processes involved in peripersonal space perception. These models were designed to mimic the neural circuits involved in this process and were calibrated using data from healthy individuals.

We then used these models to simulate the effects of schizophrenia on peripersonal space perception. Specifically, we looked at how changes in neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity, as well as other factors, could affect the perception of peripersonal space in people with schizophrenia.

## üìä Results

Our results show that changes in neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity can indeed affect peripersonal space perception in people with schizophrenia. We found that people with schizophrenia have a smaller peripersonal space boundary, which may contribute to their symptoms.

After running simulations using the model, we found some interesting results that shed light on the underlying mechanisms of cognitive processing in the brain. These results will be presented in a forthcoming publication.

## üí¨ Discussion

These findings have important implications for our understanding of schizophrenia and may help to develop new treatments for this debilitating disorder. By using computational models, we were able to gain new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying peripersonal space perception and how they are affected by schizophrenia.

## üíª Implementation

Using insights from the literature review, I implemented a computational model of cognitive processing in the brain. The model uses neural net to simulate the behavior of neurons and synapses in the brain, allowing us to explore how different factors (such as schizophrenia or multisensory learning) might affect cognitive function.
